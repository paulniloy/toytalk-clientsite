                <div className='text-2xl italic font-medium'>Qus : What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</div>
                <div className='p-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer:</span> Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API.
                    <br />
                    Refresh tokens allow the application to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate, making it a useful tool for long-lived or background applications. Follow along as we walk through the process of implementing refresh token functionality in React.
                    <br />
                    For web applications, it is recommended to store the access token in an HTTP-only cookie. This prevents the access token from being accessed by JavaScript, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
                    The refresh token, being long-lived, can be stored in either an HTTP-only cookie or secure local storage, depending on the security requirements and trade-offs.

                <div className='text-2xl italic font-medium'>Qus : Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</div>
                <div className='p-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer:</span>SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two different approaches to storing and retrieving data, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
                    <br />
                    SQL databases are based on a relational model and have been the traditional choice for storing structured data. They use structured tables with predefined schemas, where data is organized into rows and columns. SQL databases provide strong consistency, enforce data integrity through constraints and relationships, and support complex queries using SQL language. They are well-suited for applications that require strict data consistency, complex joins, and transactions. SQL databases are widely adopted and have a mature ecosystem with established standards.
                    <br />
                    On the other hand, NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data at a larger scale. They offer flexible schemas or schema-less designs, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures. NoSQL databases come in different flavors, including key-value stores, document databases, columnar databases, and graph databases. They prioritize scalability, high availability, and distributed architectures. NoSQL databases often provide eventual consistency, allowing for faster reads and writes but sacrificing strict data consistency. They excel in scenarios with large volumes of data, high write throughput, and the need for horizontal scalability.
                    <br />
                    The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of an application. SQL databases are a better fit for applications with complex relationships, structured data, and a need for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. They are commonly used in banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications with strict data integrity requirements. NoSQL databases are ideal for handling massive amounts of unstructured or rapidly changing data, such as social media platforms, IoT applications, and real-time analytics. They offer horizontal scalability, flexible data models, and high availability.
                    <br />
                    It's worth noting that the distinction between SQL and NoSQL databases is not absolute, and there are hybrid databases that combine elements of both worlds. These databases, known as NewSQL or multimodel databases, aim to provide the benefits of SQL and NoSQL approaches, offering the flexibility of NoSQL with the ACID compliance and rich querying capabilities of SQL.
                    <br />
                    Ultimately, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors such as data structure, scalability needs, performance requirements, consistency requirements, and the overall goals of the application. Understanding the trade-offs and strengths of each type is essential for making an informed decision when selecting the appropriate database solution.

                <div className='p-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer:</span> Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.
                    <br /> Nest. js is a server-side Node. js framework that's great for building highly testable and maintainable backend applications. You can create countless types of applications with Node. js; you're only limited by your applications' features.

                <div className='p-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer:</span>In MongoDB, the aggregate method is a powerful feature that allows you to perform advanced data aggregation operations on your data. It enables you to process and transform documents within a collection to generate meaningful results, such as calculating sums, averages, grouping data, and performing complex calculations.
                <br />
                    The aggregate method works by taking an array of stages, where each stage represents a specific operation in the aggregation pipeline. The pipeline consists of multiple stages that are executed sequentially, with the output of one stage serving as the input for the next stage. This allows you to compose a series of operations to perform complex aggregations.
